# Exploring The GDELT Global Knowledge Graph

### The GDELT dataset is unique in that its proposed mission is to codify all of humanity's events as recorded across myriad media sources.
### As such, GDELT data lends itself to many possible use cases, most notably perhaps that of sentiment analysis.
### From a data engineering perspective, the GDELT dataset poses many challenges and requires employing the most current and sophisticated data engineering practices in order to successfully work with it.
### For these reasons, I have chosen to focus my capstone project on building a GDELT database and exploring some of the possible ways in which in may be used for future analysis.
