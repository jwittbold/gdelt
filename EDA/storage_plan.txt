- Apache Kafka w/ Zookeeper - For handling real-time data feeds. Used to publish and subscribe to GDELT topics.
- Apache Parquet - compression schemes specified on per column level, stores data schema with the data itself.
- Apache Avro - serializes data in compact, binary format.
- Elasticsearch - for full-text search of GDELT data.
